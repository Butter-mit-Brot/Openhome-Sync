## 📌 What is Openhome Sync?

**Openhome Sync** is an application that synchronizes **Home Assistant light entities** with the **colors of your PC screen**.

My goal was to create a tool similar to **Philips Hue Sync**, but fully integrated into **Home Assistant** — enabling custom Ambilight setups without the Hue ecosystem.

## 🎛 Available Modes

You can choose between **3 different modes**:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 💻 **Screen Mode** | Uses the lamp’s defined position and takes the pixel color from that exact screen spot. |
| 🟰 **Average Mode** | Calculates the average color of 4 predefined screen areas (lamp position doesn’t matter). |
| 😵‍💫 **Crazy Mode** | Uses the color of the pixel currently under your mouse cursor. |

After selecting a mode, press **Start**.  
If setup correctly, your lights will react instantly to your screen’s colors.
